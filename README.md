# First-Contributon
So here we are creating contributor repository so that later we can access,pull,fork,clone etc
here we can create a contributor from settings and give the access of a particular repository,so that the person can access to my account's mentioned repository and will see a fork button in the top right,on clicking it,the repository will be forked and same copy of the folder will be created in person2's repository

whatever changes are done here will not affect the person1(owner)'s repository and it's folders and files
